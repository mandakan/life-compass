  "brief_life_compass_intruction": "The Life Compass consists of ten areas that are typically important to most people. In each box, write down a few words about what you would value or consider important in that particular area. Each area also includes two small boxes. In the left box, rate how important each area is in your life on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means unimportant and 10 means very important. Base your rating on how life would be if everything were exactly as you wanted it to be.  \n\n In the right box, rate how much you have lived in accordance with your values in the past week, where 1 means not at all and 10 means completely in line with your values. Then, examine the differences between these numbers. Can you identify any areas that are important to you but where you are not living as you would like? If so, reflect on what is preventing you!",
