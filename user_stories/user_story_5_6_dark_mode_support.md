# Implement Dark Mode

## 📌 Description

Users should be able to switch between light and dark mode to improve visual comfort.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Dark mode follows the same design principles as light mode and is automatically detected based on system settings.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- Users can manually toggle between modes via a settings menu.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should dark mode use different UI styles or just invert colors?
- How do we ensure a seamless experience when switching between modes?
- Should we allow per-user preferences to persist across sessions?
