# Rate Life Areas

## üìå Description

The user should be able to rate both importance and satisfaction for each life area on a scale of 1‚Äì10. The rating inputs should be intuitive, user-friendly, and provide instant visual feedback to confirm user actions. These ratings are to be stored locally and should dynamically update the UI. Where applicable, the ratings may also influence the ordering or presentation of life areas in other areas of the application.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Two separate rating scales (1‚Äì10) per life area, one for importance and one for satisfaction.
- Ratings inputs update in real-time, reflecting the changes immediately in the UI.
- Data is persisted in local storage.
- Input validations ensure only numbers within the specified range are accepted.
- Changes to ratings update any aggregated metrics or visual indicators across the application.

## üéØ Definition of Done

- The rating inputs are implemented uniformly across the application.
- Unit and integration tests confirm that rating updates are handled correctly.
- The UI provides clear visual feedback (animations, color changes, etc.) when ratings are changed or saved.
- Documentation specifies how ratings interact with other features (such as reordering life areas based on importance).
- User feedback is considered for accessibility, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## ‚ùì Refinement Questions

- Should users be allowed to reorder life areas based on importance after setting their ratings? Yes.
- What specific visual feedback should be implemented upon rating changes‚Äîjust color/highlight changes, or animations as well? Nothing to distracting but something that gives a nice visual experience.
- Are there any preferences between slider controls and numeric input fields for these ratings? Let's go with slider controls to start with.
- Should there be a confirmation prompt for significant changes, or do we go with auto-save for all rating updates? Auto-save for all updates.
- How should non-numeric or out-of-bound inputs be handled? Should there be error messages or input masks? With a slider this should not be a problem but if there are out-of-bounds inputs then display an error in the same way as for duplicate names.
- In cases where ratings influence other parts of the application (e.g., aggregated reporting), what are the expected interactions or recalculations? Non at this point.
- Have any parts of this feature already been partially implemented (for example, in the LifeAreaCard component) that need to be revisited or integrated with these requirements? Yes. Revisit the existing component LifeAreaCard and CreateLifeCompass. Some of the features are already implemented.

## üìö Additional Context

- Consider reviewing linked tests and related UI components (such as LifeAreaCard.tsx) to ensure alignment with the refined requirements.
- Further refinements may be required once user feedback is gathered from initial implementations.
