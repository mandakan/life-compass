# Define Tech Stack and Frameworks

## 📌 Description

The application should have a well-defined technology stack to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- A documentation file specifies the technologies used (e.g., JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Local Storage).

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- All dependencies are managed in a package.json file for easy installation.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should we use TypeScript for better maintainability?
- What frontend framework, if any, should we consider?
- Should we support SSR (Server-Side Rendering) in a future version?
