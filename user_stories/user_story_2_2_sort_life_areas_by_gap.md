# Sort Life Areas by Gap Size

## 📌 Description
The user should be able to sort life areas based on the size of their gaps.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- A sorting option allows users to list areas from highest to lowest gap.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Sorting persists across sessions using Local Storage.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we allow toggling between sorting by importance, satisfaction, or gap size?
- How do we ensure users can still easily navigate their life areas?
- Should we provide sorting presets for different use cases?
