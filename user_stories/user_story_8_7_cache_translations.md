# Cache Translations Locally

## 📌 Description
The application should cache automatically generated translations to avoid repeated API calls and improve performance.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Automatically translated content is stored in Local Storage or IndexedDB.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Previously translated text is reused instead of making repeated API calls.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- How do we ensure that cached translations stay up-to-date?
- Should users be able to clear or reset cached translations?
- What fallback mechanism should be used if cached translations are unavailable?
