# Implement Automatic Translation Support

## 📌 Description
The application should support automatic translation of UI content using an external API (e.g., Google Translate, DeepL).

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- A translation API is integrated, allowing dynamic translation of missing text.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Users can opt to enable or disable automatic translation.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should automatic translation be applied only to missing text or the entire UI?
- How do we handle rate limits and costs associated with API usage?
- Should we allow fallback to manually provided translations when available?
