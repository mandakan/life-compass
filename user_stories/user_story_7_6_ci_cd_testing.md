# Integrate Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

## üìå Description

All tests should be automatically executed in the CI/CD pipeline before code is deployed.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Unit tests and integration tests run automatically on each pull request.
- Tests are executed using Vitest and React Testing Library.

## üéØ Definition of Done

- Code is only merged if all tests pass successfully.
- The CI/CD pipeline is configured to run unit and integration tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.

## ‚ùì Refinement Questions

### Testing Scope and Frameworks
- We are starting with unit tests and integration tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- In the future, should we expand to include additional types of tests (e.g., accessibility or performance tests)?
  - Answer (if any): [Your answer here]

### Environment and CI/CD Tooling
- Which CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.) will be used for running these tests?
  - Answer: [Please provide your answer]
- Are there any specific environment configurations required before running the tests?
  - Answer: [Please provide details]

### Handling Flaky Tests
- What strategy should we adopt to manage flaky tests? Would you prefer automatic retries, or should we temporarily exempt certain tests?
  - Answer: [Your answer here]
- Do we need to set limits on the number of retries for tests that intermittently fail?
  - Answer: [Your answer here]

### Pipeline Performance
- Should tests be executed in parallel to speed up the build process? If so, what strategy do you prefer (e.g., splitting tests into multiple jobs)?
  - Answer: [Your answer here]

### Reporting and Feedback
- What reporting tools or formats should be used to visualize test results (e.g., JUnit XML, HTML dashboards)?
  - Answer: [Your answer here]
- Should test reports be stored as artifacts or published to an external dashboard?
  - Answer: [Your answer here]

### Definition of Done Enhancements
- Should the definition of done include a specific code coverage percentage that must be met?
  - Answer: [Your answer here]
- Are there any additional quality checks (like linting or security scans) that should also be integrated alongside the tests?
  - Answer: [Your answer here]

Please provide your feedback on these questions so we can further refine the user story.
