# Integrate Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

## 📌 Description
All tests should be automatically executed in the CI/CD pipeline before code is deployed.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Unit, integration, and accessibility tests run automatically on each pull request.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Code is only merged if all tests pass successfully.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- How do we handle flaky tests to prevent blocking deployments?
- Should we implement parallel test execution for faster results?
- What reporting tools should we use to visualize test results?
