# Implement Mobile-First Layout

## üìå Description
The application should be optimized for mobile-first usage and adapt seamlessly to larger screens. This includes ensuring that all UI components and interactions are responsive and provide a good user experience across different devices.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- The layout scales smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Navigation components are intuitive and accessible on mobile devices.
- Text, images, and interactive elements adjust appropriately to the viewport.
- Touch-friendly interactions are implemented for mobile devices.

## üéØ Definition of Done
- Responsive design is tested in major breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px).
- Mobile navigation and touch-based interactions are fully functional.
- Media queries and dynamic scaling adjustments are implemented.
- Consistent UX is achieved across devices through user testing.

## ‚ùì Refinement Questions
1. What specific viewport breakpoints should be prioritized for testing (e.g., 320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px)?
2. Should there be a dedicated design for landscape mode, particularly on tablets and larger mobile devices?
3. How do we handle scaling of images and media assets, especially on high-resolution screens?
4. Is there a need to adjust typography sizes and spacing specifically for mobile views?
5. Are there any performance benchmarks or specific tests for ensuring touch interactions are responsive?
6. Do we require any special animations or transitions that are optimized for mobile devices?

Please provide answers to these questions to further refine the requirements.
