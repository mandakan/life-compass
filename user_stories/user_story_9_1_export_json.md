# Export Data as JSON

## üìå Description

The application should allow users to export their data as a human-readable JSON file. This export should be accessible with a single click and should gather all relevant components such as user settings, life areas, and history.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Users can download their data in JSON format with a single click.
- The exported JSON file is formatted to be easily readable and maintainable.
- The export includes all user settings, life areas, and history unless user-specific filters are applied.
- The export process handles potential errors gracefully.

## üéØ Definition of Done

- The exported file contains all user settings, life areas, and history.
- The JSON structure is validated against a defined schema that supports future imports.
- The file includes metadata such as an export timestamp and version information.
- Thorough testing has been completed to ensure that all relevant data is captured.
- Documentation is updated to explain the export format and any limitations.

## ‚ùì Refinement Questions

- Should we allow users to select or filter specific data to export, e.g., excluding history or certain settings? No, not at this point.
- How do we ensure the exported file is structured in a way that supports future imports and potential changes in the data schema? Good question. Maybe keep some kind of versioning of the export format.
- Should exported files include additional metadata such as timestamps, versioning information, or user identifiers? Yes.
- What precautions should be considered regarding sensitive data? Should there be an option to exclude or mask such information? No.
- How should error conditions be handled? For example, if local storage is unavailable or data is corrupted. Show an error to the user.
- Should the JSON export support compression (e.g., .zip) for large data sets? Yes but only for very large datasets.
- What is the required JSON schema and how can it be validated programmatically both on export and import? We need to derive this from the internal data format.
- Are there any performance considerations for the export process when dealing with large data sets? No.
- Should we provide a sample JSON schema in the documentation for developers and advanced users? Not as top prio at this point.
