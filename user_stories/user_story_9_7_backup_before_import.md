# Create Backup Before Importing

## 📌 Description
Before importing new data, the application should automatically create a backup of the current state.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- A timestamped backup is saved in Local Storage or provided as a downloadable file.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Users can revert to their previous data if they are unhappy with the import.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we allow users to store multiple backups for future reference?
- How do we prevent backups from using excessive storage?
- Should backups be automatically deleted after a certain period?
