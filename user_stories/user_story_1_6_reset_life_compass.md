# Reset Life Compass

## 📌 Description

The user should have an option to reset all data and start fresh.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- A confirmation prompt ensures users do not reset data accidentally.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- The reset function clears Local Storage and reloads the app state.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should we allow partial resets (e.g., only reset ratings but keep areas)?
- How do we handle user confirmation to prevent accidental resets?
- Should we include a backup function before resetting?
