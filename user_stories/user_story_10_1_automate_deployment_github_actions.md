# Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions

## 📌 Description

The application should be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to `main`.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- A GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys the app.
- The app is accessible via a GitHub Pages URL.
- Deployment process is documented in `README.md`.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- GitHub Actions workflow exists and runs successfully.
- Deployed app updates automatically after a push to `main`.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should we trigger deployment on all merges to `main` or only on releases?
- Should we add notifications for failed deployments?
- Do we need environment-specific configurations for staging and production?
