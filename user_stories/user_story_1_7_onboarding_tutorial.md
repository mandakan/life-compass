# Onboarding Tutorial

## 📌 Description

New users should be guided through an engaging, step-by-step onboarding tutorial that clearly explains how to use the key features of the app. The tutorial should be intuitive, unobtrusive, and allow users to either complete it, skip it, or revisit it at any time through the app’s settings or help menu.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The onboarding tutorial introduces key app features in a clear and engaging manner.
- The tutorial is presented as an interactive guide that uses tooltips, modal popups, or an interactive walkthrough.
- Users are given the option to skip the onboarding tutorial at the beginning.
- Users can access and replay the onboarding tutorial after the initial experience.
- The tutorial is adaptable to different user types by offering optional, context-sensitive guidance.
- The implementation adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility).

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- An interactive onboarding tutorial is fully implemented and integrated in the app.
- Users are able to skip or revisit the tutorial seamlessly.
- The tutorial has been tested with a sample group of new users and refined based on their feedback.
- Accessibility guidelines and responsive design principles are followed.
- Documentation is updated to reflect the new onboarding flow.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should the tutorial provide different pathways based on the user’s self-identified experience level? Yes. During the tutorial the user shall be presented with the option to begin with or without the predefined life areas.
- Is it preferable to implement the guide using tooltips, modals, or a combination of both? A combination.
- What metrics should be tracked to determine the tutorial’s effectiveness? None at this point.
- Should there be an option to provide feedback on the tutorial directly within the onboarding sequence? No.
