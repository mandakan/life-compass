# Optimize Language Loading for Performance

## 📌 Description

The application should load language files dynamically to minimize initial load time.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Only necessary translations are loaded instead of bundling all languages at once.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- Language changes do not require a full page reload.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should we preload the default language for better performance?
- How do we handle offline scenarios where language files might not be available?
- Should we cache translations to avoid unnecessary reloading?
