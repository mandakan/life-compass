# Allow Partial Data Import

## 📌 Description
Users should have the option to import only specific sections of their data instead of replacing everything.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Users can choose which life areas, ratings, or goals they want to restore.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Only selected data is merged into the existing Life Compass.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we provide recommendations on what to import based on missing data?
- How do we ensure conflicts between imported and existing data are handled smoothly?
- Should we allow users to undo an import if they change their mind?
