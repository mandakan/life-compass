# Warn Users Before Overwriting Data

## 📌 Description

If a user imports data while they already have existing data, they should be warned before overwriting.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- A confirmation dialog is shown before replacing existing data.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- Users have the option to cancel the import if they wish to keep their current data.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should we allow merging imported data with existing data instead of overwriting?
- How do we prevent accidental overwrites while keeping the process user-friendly?
- Should we provide an automatic backup before overwriting existing data?
