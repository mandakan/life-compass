# Implement Language Switcher in UI

## 📌 Description
Users should be able to switch between supported languages within the application settings.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- A dropdown or button allows users to change the language.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- The selected language is saved in Local Storage and persists across sessions.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we detect the user's browser language on the first visit?
- How do we ensure that all UI components dynamically update on language change?
- Should we allow users to set different languages for UI and content separately?
