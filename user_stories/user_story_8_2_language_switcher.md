# Implement Language Switcher in UI

## üìå Description

Users should be able to switch between supported languages within the application settings, providing a localized experience. The language switcher should be intuitive and responsive, allowing easy toggling between languages available in the app.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- A dropdown or button allows users to change the language.
- The list of languages should clearly display the name of each language in its own language (e.g., English, Svenska).
- The interface updates immediately when a new language is selected.
- The language selection is stored in Local Storage and persists across sessions.
- The language switcher is accessible and fully keyboard navigable.

## üéØ Definition of Done

- The functionality is implemented in the settings page.
- Local Storage correctly persists the selected language.
- All UI components respond dynamically to language changes without requiring a full page refresh.
- Comprehensive unit tests cover the new functionality.
- The design of the language switcher follows the application's UI conventions.

## ‚ùì Refinement Questions

- Should we detect the user's browser language on the first visit and pre-select it? Yes.
- How do we ensure that all UI components dynamically update on language change without a full page reload? Follow best practices based on that we are using i18next.
- Should we allow users to set different languages for UI and content separately, or should there be a unified language setting? Use a unified setting for now.
- What error handling should be implemented if the language resource file fails to load? Default to english or the first available file.
- How should the app behave in offline mode, particularly if connected language files are not available? Is it possible to always cache/load the user's browser language and english to have as fallback?
- Are there any design guidelines or constraints we need to consider for the placement and style of the language switcher in the UI? Follow UX and design best-practices as well as design_principles.md. The app must stay distraction free.
- What are the fallback options if selected language resources are incomplete or missing translations? Use english.
- The user must be informed which languages are unverified. The only verified language at this point is sv, all others must have an icon such as ‚ö† in the language selector with additional information on hover or in a footnote.
