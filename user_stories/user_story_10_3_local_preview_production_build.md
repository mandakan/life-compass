# Enable Local Preview of Production Build

## 📌 Description

Developers should be able to test the production build locally before deployment to GitHub Pages.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Running `npm run preview` serves the built app locally.
- Documentation explains how to test before deployment.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- Build process allows local preview.
- Instructions added to `DEV_SETUP.md`.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should the local preview automatically mimic GitHub Pages' environment?
- Do we need a script to check for common production issues before deployment?
- Should the preview mode include debugging tools?
