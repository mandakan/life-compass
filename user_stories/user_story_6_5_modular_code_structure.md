# Use a Modular Code Structure

## 📌 Description
The codebase should follow a modular structure to allow easy maintenance and future expansions.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Separate concerns (UI components, logic, storage handling) are clearly defined in different modules.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- All functions are reusable and follow best practices.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we adopt a component-based architecture for UI?
- How do we structure state management across different parts of the app?
- Should we use a design pattern like MVC or MVVM?
