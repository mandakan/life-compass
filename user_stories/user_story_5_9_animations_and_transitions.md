# Implement Smooth Animations and Transitions

## 📌 Description
UI interactions should include smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Animations are subtle and do not interfere with usability.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Users can disable animations if they prefer a static experience.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we provide accessibility settings to reduce motion effects?
- How do we ensure animations enhance usability rather than distract?
- What library or approach should we use for animations (e.g., Framer Motion)?
