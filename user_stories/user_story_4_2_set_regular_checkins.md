# Set Regular Check-ins

## 📌 Description
The user should be able to set reminders for self-assessment updates.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Users can choose check-in intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly).

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- The app notifies users when it's time to update their life compass.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we allow different frequencies for different life areas?
- How should reminders be delivered (notifications, emails, etc.)?
- Should we allow skipping check-ins without losing progress?
