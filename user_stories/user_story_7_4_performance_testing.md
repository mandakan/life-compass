# Optimize Performance Through Testing

## 📌 Description

The application should be tested for performance under different conditions to ensure smooth operation.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Performance tests analyze load time, rendering efficiency, and memory usage.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- Bottlenecks are identified and optimized.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should we use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or another tool for performance monitoring?
- How do we ensure performance remains stable across different devices?
- Should we test with simulated slow networks to optimize performance for all users?
