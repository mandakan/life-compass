# Create Life Compass

## 📌 Description

The user should be able to create a life compass with customizable life areas. The implementation should allow the user to either choose from a set of predefined life areas or define their own custom areas. The process should be straightforward and intuitive, ensuring that first-time users can easily understand and use the feature.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The user can choose between predefined life areas or opt to create custom life areas.
- The created life compass is stored in Local Storage and persists between sessions.
- The interface guides the user through the creation process with clear instructions.
- The UI should accommodate error handling (e.g., if Local Storage is unavailable).

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- The UX flow is designed, implemented, and tested for both predefined and custom life areas.
- Data persists reliably in Local Storage.
- Basic validations are in place for custom life area creation.
- Unit tests cover the core functionalities of life compass creation.
- The feature has been reviewed for responsiveness and accessibility.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- What specific UI components or layout patterns should be used to guide the user through the life compass creation process?
- How should the system handle scenarios where Local Storage is not available or fails?
- Are there any animations or transitions that are preferred or required during the onboarding of this feature?
- What error messages or fallback behaviors should we implement in case of invalid input or storage errors?
- Should we provide tooltips or additional help prompts for first-time users during the creation process?
- Are there any design constraints regarding the customization of life areas (e.g., maximum number of areas, character limits) that we should enforce?
