# Define Translation Structure

## 📌 Description
The application should have a structured way to store and manage translations for different languages.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- A JSON-based or equivalent format is used to store language strings.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- The application dynamically loads language files based on the selected language.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we use a library like i18next for handling translations?
- How do we structure translations to keep them scalable?
- Should we support right-to-left (RTL) languages in the future?
