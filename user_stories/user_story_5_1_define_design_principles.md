# Define Design Principles

## üìå Description

The application should follow a clear and consistent design system to ensure a smooth user experience. This user story focuses on establishing the design principles that guide color schemes, typography, layout, interactions, and accessibility. A well-defined design system will contribute to both usability and performance across devices.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- A design document is created that outlines the color palette, typography, layout guidelines, and interaction principles.
- The design document addresses accessibility requirements (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance) and user preferences such as dark mode.
- The design principles are reviewed by stakeholders and are easily referenced by both development and design teams.
- A prototype or mockup is developed to demonstrate applying these principles across key pages and UI components.

## üéØ Definition of Done

- The design document is complete and approved by all relevant stakeholders.
- At least one prototype or style guide is developed showcasing the application of these principles.
- The design principles are accessible to the development team and incorporated into the codebase via guidelines or a component library.
- Testing strategies for accessibility, responsiveness, and performance are outlined and scheduled.

## ‚ùì Refinement Questions

- How do we ensure accessibility compliance (e.g., adherence to WCAG 2.1 standards) within our design principles?
- Should dark mode be implemented as an option, and if so, what are the specific color scheme and contrast requirements?
- What key UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, cards) should be prioritized for detailed design guidelines in this document?
- Would stakeholders prefer to see prototype/mockups for key pages (such as the landing page and main dashboard) as part of the design document?
- Are there any performance considerations (for instance, minimal resource usage in transitions and animations) that should be factored into these principles?
- How should the design guidelines be documented and distributed to ensure consistency across design and development teams?
