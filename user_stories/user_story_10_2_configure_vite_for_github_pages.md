# Configure Vite for GitHub Pages

## 📌 Description

The Vite configuration should be updated to support GitHub Pages deployment without breaking routes or assets.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- `vite.config.ts` is updated with the correct `base` path.
- Environment variable is used to configure the base path to ensure that it is served from the root path locally
  and the correct repo path on GitHub Pages.
- The deployed app works without 404 errors.
- Instructions for correct configuration are documented in `README.md`.

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- Vite config updated and committed.
- Deployment verified on GitHub Pages.

## ❓ Refinement Questions

- Should we handle different base paths dynamically for local vs production builds?
- How do we ensure proper asset loading in GitHub Pages?
- Should we provide an automated test to verify deployment correctness?
