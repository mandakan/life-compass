# Implement Crowdsourced Review System

## 📌 Description
The application should allow multiple users to review and vote on user-generated translations for accuracy.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- A voting system enables users to upvote or downvote suggested translations.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Translations with enough positive votes are automatically approved.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we set a minimum threshold before translations are accepted?
- How do we prevent abuse (e.g., users upvoting their own translations)?
- Should we have a moderation team for final approval of translations?
