# Develop Consistent UI Components

## 📌 Description
The application should use reusable and consistent UI components for input fields, buttons, and cards.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- All major UI components follow a unified design language.

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- Components are implemented using Tailwind CSS or an equivalent framework.

## ❓ Refinement Questions
- Should we use a component library like Radix UI for accessibility?
- How do we ensure UI consistency without bloating the CSS framework?
- Should we implement custom UI components for unique interactions?
