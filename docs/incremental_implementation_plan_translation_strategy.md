## Overview

This plan outlines the incremental steps to implement the translation strategy in our application using i18next. The plan covers setting up the translation library, organizing flat JSON translation files, configuring dynamic loading with a fallback to English, handling pluralization and gender rules, and integrating translation string extraction via i18next-parser.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up i18next in the Project
- Install i18next and react-i18next along with any necessary middleware.
- Configure i18next with basic options:
  - Use flat JSON files for storing translations.
  - Set English as the fallback language.
  - Enable logging of missing translation keys in development (disabled in production).

### Step 2: Organize Translation Files
- Create a dedicated translations directory (e.g., `/src/translations` or `/public/locales`).
- Adopt a flat JSON file structure with naming patterns such as `en.json`, `sv.json`, etc.
- Insert a version field (e.g., `"version": "1.0.0"`) in each JSON file to ensure version consistency.
- Ensure the JSON structure supports pluralization and gender-specific rules as needed.

### Step 3: Implement Dynamic Loading of Translation Files
- Configure i18next to load the language files dynamically based on the user's selection.
- Add a mechanism to verify the version field in the translation files. If the version does not match `"1.0.0"`, log a warning and fallback gracefully.
- Write automated tests to ensure that:
  - Files load correctly.
  - Missing keys default to English.
  - Version mismatches are detected and handled.

### Step 4: Integrate i18next-parser for Extraction
- Configure i18next-parser to extract translation strings from the codebase.
- Set up the parser to update translation JSON files with missing keys during debugging.
- Document the process for developers on how to run the parser and merge new strings into the translation files.

### Step 5: Error Handling and Logging
- Implement error handling within i18next for missing keys:
  - Log missing keys during development for developer review.
  - Collect missing translation keys for automated reporting.
- Ensure detailed logging is available in development and minimized in production to avoid performance issues.

### Step 6: Developer Documentation and Review
- Create comprehensive documentation on:
  - How to add new languages.
  - How to update translation files.
  - How to use the i18next framework within our app.
- Run a review session with stakeholders to validate that all aspects of the translation strategy are covered.

### Step 7: Testing and Deployment
- Develop and integrate automated tests to:
  - Validate translation JSON file format and version.
  - Check that the fallback mechanism works as intended.
  - Ensure that the dynamic loader retrieves the correct files based on user preference.
- Integrate these tests into the existing CI/CD pipeline.
- Include translation updates in regular app deployments.

## Additional Considerations
- Monitor performance impacts from dynamic loading and adjust caching strategies if necessary.
- Stay prepared to adjust for new translation requirements such as context-specific variants.
- Continuously review and update the translation strategy based on user feedback and emerging needs.

## Conclusion

By following these incremental steps, the translation strategy will be implemented in a structured and scalable manner. This approach ensures that our application can handle multiple languages efficiently while providing a seamless experience for users and a straightforward process for developers.
