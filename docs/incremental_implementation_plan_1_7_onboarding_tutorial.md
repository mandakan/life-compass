# Incremental Implementation Plan for Onboarding Tutorial (1.7)

This document outlines an incremental plan to implement the onboarding tutorial as described in user story 1.7. The goal is to guide new users through an engaging, step-by-step introduction to the app while offering flexibility based on their experience level. The plan is divided into phases, each with clear tasks, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.

---

## Phase 1: UI/UX Design and Prototyping

### Tasks
- Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for the onboarding flow.
- Define the placement of tooltips and modal popups.
- Plan the two pathways: one that begins with predefined life areas and one that skips them.
- Validate design choices with internal stakeholders and with a small sample of target users.

### Deliverables
- Complete set of wireframes and mockups.
- Documented flow showing step-by-step interactions.
- Annotated designs indicating interactive elements and transitions.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Designs must clearly differentiate between the two user pathways.
- Both tooltips and modals are considered, ensuring a balanced combination.
- Accessibility guidelines (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility) are integrated into the designs.

---

## Phase 2: Development Spike & Component Setup

### Tasks
- Create a new React component for the onboarding tutorial container.
- Implement reusable Tooltip and Modal components if not already available.
- Define state management for tracking the current step and user choices (i.e., selecting a pathway).
- Create a “Skip Tutorial” option at the initial stage.

### Deliverables
- A basic, navigable onboarding component and supporting UI elements.
- Integration with the app’s routing or modals system.
- Documented component interfaces and props for future enhancements.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The component renders correctly and supports switching between tooltips and modals.
- Users can opt-out immediately by skipping the tutorial.
- The UI components adhere to existing design conventions.

## Phase 3: Integration and Conditional Flows

### Tasks
- Integrate the onboarding tutorial component into the main application flow.
- Ensure that the tutorial is accessible via the settings/help menu after initial execution.
- Implement the conditional logic for the two pathways:
  - With predefined life areas.
  - Without predefined life areas.
- Ensure proper interactions between the tutorial and existing app state (e.g., setting a “tutorial completed” flag).

### Deliverables
- An integrated onboarding tutorial that triggers on first app launch.
- A settings entry point for users to revisit the tutorial.
- Code documentation on the integration details and state dependencies.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The tutorial displays or is accessible as designed in both pathways.
- User preferences (skip, complete, or replay the tutorial) are properly stored and respected.
- Accessibility and responsive design considerations are met.

---

## Phase 4: Testing and Feedback

### Tasks
- Write unit tests for the onboarding tutorial component and its conditional flows.
- Perform integration tests to ensure seamless interactions with existing components.
- Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on usability and clarity.
- Adjust UI components based on test outcomes and stakeholder comments.

### Deliverables
- A comprehensive test suite covering unit and integration tests.
- Report summarizing user testing feedback along with proposed adjustments.
- Refined onboarding tutorial based on iterative testing results.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All tests pass on CI/CD.
- User feedback confirms that the tutorial is engaging and clear.
- No critical issues remain with navigation or accessibility.

---

## Phase 5: Documentation and Final Review

### Tasks
- Update developer documentation detailing the new onboarding tutorial component and its integration.
- Update user-facing documentation/help guides to include information on how to access and use the tutorial.
- Perform a final review and walkthrough with stakeholders.
- Prepare for the production rollout.

### Deliverables
- Updated documentation in the project repository.
- Recorded changes in the project’s changelog with clear references to user story 1.7.
- Final stakeholder approval.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All relevant documentation reflects the new onboarding flow.
- The tutorial is approved by both technical and design leads.
- Production deployment plan includes a rollback strategy in case of issues.

## Timeline and Milestones

- **Week 1-2:** UI/UX Design and Prototyping completed.
- **Week 3:** Development spike and initial component creation.
- **Week 4-5:** Integration and conditional flow implementation.
- **Week 6:** Testing, user feedback, and refinements.
- **Week 7:** Documentation updates and final review.

---

## Notes

- This incremental plan will be revisited after the testing phase to incorporate any additional enhancements as needed.
- No metrics for tracking effectiveness are required at this point.
- The feedback option within the tutorial is not part of the implementation scope.
