# Design Principles

## Overview

This document outlines the design principles for the Life Compass application. It serves as a reference for both the development and design teams and is aligned with user story 5.1: Define Design Principles. These guidelines ensure consistency in color schemes, typography, layout, interactive states, and accessibility throughout the application.

## 1. Color Tokens and Themes

- Define color tokens for a small project using best practices.
- Primary Color: #3490dc
- Secondary Color: #ffed4a
- Accent Color: #e3342f
- Neutral Colors: A range of grays as needed.
- Implement light and dark themes. For dark mode, adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation to adhere to accessibility guidelines.

## 2. Typography

- Use system fonts to optimize performance.
- Primary font should be a sans-serif (for example, "Inter" or "Roboto, sans-serif").
- Follow Tailwind CSS typography defaults for font sizes, with adjustments for headings, sub-headings, and body text as needed.

## 3. Layout Guidelines

- Adopt a mobile-first approach.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes to define layout, spacing, and alignment.
- Design key UI components (cards, forms, buttons) with consistent margins, padding, and alignment.
- For desktop devices, arrange certain components (like cards representing life areas) in creative layouts (e.g., circular arrangement) while ensuring a fluid transition from mobile to desktop layouts.

## 4. Interactive States

- Define clear guidelines for interactive states such as hover, focus, and active.
- UI components should provide visual feedback:
  - Hover: Subtle color change or shadow effect.
  - Focus: Clear outline or border change to meet accessibility standards.
  - Active: Slight size adjustment or color shift, ensuring users recognize their interactions.
- All interactive states must be designed with accessibility in mind (WCAG 2.1 compliance).

## 5. Responsive Breakpoints

- Use the default Tailwind CSS breakpoints to ensure layouts adapt across devices.
- Confirm that all UI components maintain usability and aesthetics from mobile to desktop views.
- Utilize fluid layouts and scaling to accommodate varying screen sizes.

## 6. Accessibility and Performance

- Ensure all text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 contrast and focus requirements.
- Use minimal transitions and animations to provide a distraction-free experience, especially considering users who may be managing stress or depression.
- Optimize all design elements for performance to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.

## 7. Distribution and Documentation

- These design guidelines are documented here and cross-referenced in the CONVENTIONS.md file.
- Example pages, component libraries, or prototypes (showcasing cards, buttons, and forms) should be created and shared with both design and development teams.
- Regular reviews and updates will ensure the design system remains consistent and adaptable as the project evolves.

## Conclusion

This living document establishes the initial design principles for the Life Compass application. As the project develops, further feedback and iterations will be applied to refine these guidelines.
