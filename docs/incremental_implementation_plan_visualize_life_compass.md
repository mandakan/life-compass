# Incremental Implementation Plan for "Visualize Life Compass"

## Overview

This incremental implementation plan outlines the steps required to develop the "Visualize Life Compass" feature. The plan breaks the work into manageable iterations so that incremental progress can be demonstrated and user feedback can be incorporated throughout the development process.

## Step 1: Initial Visualization Prototype

- Develop a basic radar chart component that accepts dynamic ratings as input.
- Integrate the radar chart with the Life Compass data model to display the current ratings.
- Ensure the component renders correctly on desktop screens.
- Implement basic interactivity by showing a tooltip on hover with the rating details.

## Step 2: Enhance Responsiveness and Adaptability

- Make the radar chart fully responsive across different device sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- Dynamically adjust the chart dimensions based on the container size.
- Test and optimize the layout for various screen orientations and resolutions.

## Step 3: Expand Interactivity and Accessibility

- Refine the hover and focus states to display detailed information, including importance, satisfaction, and additional details.
- Implement accessibility features such as keyboard navigation and focus indicators.
- Adapt the visualization for users with visual impairments by ensuring high contrast and considering alternative patterns or labels as per WCAG guidelines.

## Step 4: Graphical vs. Textual Toggle and Data Fallback Handling

- Add a user control to switch between the graphical radar chart and a textual representation.
- Implement logic to detect incomplete data and display a clear notification prompting the user to fill in missing information.
- Ensure both visual and textual representations adhere to accessibility standards.

## Step 5: Export Functionality and Final Enhancements

- Develop functionality to allow users to export the visualization as an image or PDF, complete with legends and annotations.
- Optimize performance for real-time updates, particularly on lower-powered devices.
- Conduct comprehensive usability, performance, and accessibility testing.
- Gather user feedback and refine the design as necessary.

## Final Integration and Documentation

- Integrate the fully tested visualization feature into the Life Compass interface.
- Update both user-facing and technical documentation to reflect the changes and new features.
- Prepare for a staged rollout to ensure smooth adoption and to address any initial issues promptly.

## Measurements of Success

- Dynamic rendering of the radar chart that accurately reflects real-time updates.
- Positive user feedback on usability, accessibility, and overall responsiveness across devices.
- Successful export of visualizations with all contextual information included.
- Minimal performance issues during testing phases, ensuring a smooth user experience.
