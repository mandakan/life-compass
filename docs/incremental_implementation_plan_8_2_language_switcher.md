# Incremental Implementation Plan for Language Switcher (8.2)

This document outlines an incremental plan to implement the language switcher feature as defined in user story 8.2. The plan is divided into multiple stages to ensure a smooth rollout of the functionality, thorough testing, and adherence to our design principles and UX guidelines.

---

## Stage 1: UI Component Creation

### Objectives

- Create a simple, reusable language selector component.
- Provide a dropdown or button-based interface.
- Display each language in its own language (e.g., English for en, Svenska for sv).

### Steps

1. **Design Component Layout:**

   - Sketch the layout for the language switcher ensuring minimal distraction.
   - Follow the design guidelines as outlined in `CONVENTIONS.md` and `design_principles.md`.

2. **Develop the Base Component:**

   - Create a new React component (e.g., `LanguageSwitcher.tsx` in `src/components/`).
   - Implement the UI using Tailwind CSS to match the app’s visual design.
   - Ensure that each language is displayed with its native name. For non-verified languages (all except Swedish), append an icon such as ⚠ next to the name.

3. **Accessibility Considerations:**
   - Ensure the component is fully keyboard navigable.
   - Use appropriate ARIA attributes.

## Stage 2: Integration with i18next

### Objectives

- Integrate the component with i18next for dynamic language switching.
- Ensure that language resources load correctly and the interface updates instantly.

### Steps

1. **Initialize i18next:**

   - Verify that i18next is initialized in the application (usually in `src/i18n.ts`).
   - Configure i18next to support lazy loading of language resource files.

2. **Implement Language Switching Logic:**

   - In the language switcher, hook into i18next’s change language function.
   - Ensure that changing the language triggers a re-render of UI components that consume translations.

3. **Live Update Testing:**
   - Confirm that the UI updates dynamically upon language change without a full page reload.

## Stage 3: Persisting Language Selection

### Objectives

- Store the selected language in Local Storage.
- Ensure persistence of language preference across sessions.

### Steps

1. **Save to Local Storage:**

   - When a language is selected, store the language code in Local Storage.
   - Use a consistent key (e.g., `selectedLanguage`).

2. **Load Language on App Start:**
   - On application initialization, check Local Storage for a language setting.
   - If found, apply it immediately using i18next.
   - If not found, default to detecting the user’s browser language.

---

## Stage 4: Browser Language Detection and Fallback

### Objectives

- Detect user’s browser language on the first visit.
- Implement fallback mechanisms when language resources are incomplete or unavailable.

### Steps

1. **Detect Browser Language:**

   - Implement logic to detect the browser language.
   - Pre-select the detected language if supported by the app.

2. **Fallbacks:**

   - Default to English (or the first available language) if the browser language is not supported or resource files cannot be loaded.
   - For incomplete translations, fallback to English.

3. **Offline and Error Handling:**
   - Cache the user’s language resource files where appropriate.
   - If a language resource fails to load, inform the user and fallback to English.

---

## Stage 5: Verification and UX Enhancements

### Objectives

- Provide clear visual indicators for unverified languages.
- Enhance user feedback and documentation.

### Steps

1. **Display Verification Icons:**

   - For each language in the language selector, check if it is verified (only Swedish is verified at this point).
   - Append a warning icon (⚠) next to unverified languages with additional information provided on hover or via a footnote.

2. **User Information:**

   - Include a tooltip or link in the selector that explains which languages are verified and which are provisional.
   - Update documentation to reflect this behavior.

3. **Testing and QA:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for the language switcher component.
   - Test across different devices and browsers ensuring accessibility compliance.

---

## Stage 6: Rollout and Deployment

### Objectives

- Deploy the language switcher and gather user feedback.
- Monitor and iterate based on feedback.

### Steps

1. **Feature Flag Implementation:**
   - Optionally introduce a feature flag to roll out the language switcher to a subset of users.
2. **User Feedback Collection:**

   - Monitor usage through analytics and user feedback.
   - Document any issues encountered and iterate on the solution.

3. **Final Deployment:**
   - Once thoroughly tested, remove the feature flag and enable the language switcher for all users.
   - Update release notes and user documentation accordingly.

## Summary

This incremental implementation plan ensures that the language switcher is built following our coding conventions, integrates smoothly with our existing i18next setup, and provides users with a reliable, accessible, and intuitive experience. Each stage includes clear objectives, steps, and testing strategies to minimize risk and support continuous improvement.
