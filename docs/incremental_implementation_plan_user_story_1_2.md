# Incremental Implementation Plan for User Story 1.2: Customize Life Areas

## Overview
This document outlines a step-by-step plan to incrementally implement the features for customizing life areas, as defined in user_story_1_2_customize_life_areas.md.

## Incremental Steps

1. Renaming Life Areas
   - Implement inline editing for renaming existing predefined life areas.
   - Validate input to ensure no duplicate names are allowed.
   - Provide immediate visual feedback when a name is changed.

2. Removing Life Areas
   - Add a delete option for each life area.
   - Implement a confirmation dialog before deletion to prevent accidental removals.
   - Ensure the UI updates immediately after deletion, and persist the changes.

3. Adding Custom Life Areas
   - Provide an interface for users to add new custom life areas.
   - Enforce validations to check for duplicate names.
   - While there is no hard maximum, consider showing a recommendation to keep the total to around 10 areas.

4. Reordering Life Areas
   - Utilize the existing drag-and-drop interface for reordering life areas.
   - Test and, if necessary, enhance drag-and-drop functionality to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - Provide visual cues (e.g., highlighted drop zones) during the drag operation.

5. Persistence of Changes
   - After renaming, removing, adding, or reordering life areas, persist the updated configuration in Local Storage.
   - Ensure that on app restart, the customized set of life areas is correctly reloaded.

6. Reverting to the Default Set
   - Implement a "Reset to Default" option to allow users to revert to the original, predefined life areas.
   - Display a confirmation dialog before resetting to prevent accidental data loss.

7. Testing and Feedback
   - Write unit and integration tests to cover each incremental feature.
   - Validate usability on various devices, with a focus on mobile responsiveness (especially for drag-and-drop).
   - Gather user feedback to fine-tune validations and interface guidance.

## Final Checks
- Verify that all modifications – renaming, adding, removing, reordering – work both in isolation and together.
- Ensure consistent UI behavior across different user scenarios.
- Update documentation and tests to reflect the final implementation.
