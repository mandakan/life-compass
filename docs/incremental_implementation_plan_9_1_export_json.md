# Incremental Implementation Plan for Export Data as JSON (User Story 9.1)

## Overview

This plan outlines the incremental steps to implement the export functionality that allows users to export their Life Compass data as a human-readable JSON file. The implementation covers data gathering, JSON schema definition, metadata inclusion, error handling, and performance considerations.

## Incremental Steps

1. Define JSON Schema
   - Identify required fields such as user settings, life areas, and history.
   - Include metadata fields like export timestamp and version information.
   - Ensure that the schema supports future import functionality.
   - The exported file must conform to the JSON schema defined in `src/schemas/exportImportSchema.json`. This schema specifies:
     - A top-level object with two required properties: `metadata` and `data`.
     - The `metadata` property must include:
       - `exportTimestamp`: a string in ISO date-time format.
       - `version`: a string.
     - The `data` property must include:
       - `userSettings`: an object with required properties `language` (string) and `theme` (with allowed values "light" or "dark").
       - `lifeAreas`: an array of objects, each with required properties `id` (string), `name` (string), `description` (string), `importance` (number), `satisfaction` (number), and `details` (string).
       - `history`: an array of objects representing the history log.
2. Implement Core Export Functionality

   - Add an export button in the user interface that triggers the JSON export process.
   - Gather data from Local Storage (or the internal state) and serialize it to a JSON string.
   - Validate the JSON output against the predetermined schema using a JSON schema validator (for example, Ajv).

3. Metadata Inclusion and Error Handling

   - Automatically append metadata (export timestamp, version) to the exported JSON.
   - Implement error handling for scenarios like failure to read data or JSON serialization errors.
   - Display user-friendly error messages when issues occur.

4. Optional Compression for Large Data Sets

   - Evaluate dataset size and determine if compression (e.g., creating a .zip file) is necessary.
   - Implement compression only if performance or file size becomes a concern.
   - Note: Compression should be considered only for very large datasets; for typical usage, the plain JSON file is sufficient.

5. Testing and Documentation
   - Create unit tests to validate the JSON export process and metadata correctness.
   - Develop integration tests to simulate end-to-end export scenarios.
   - Update documentation (this document and developer guides) to include:
     - The complete JSON schema (as described above and available in `src/schemas/exportImportSchema.json`).
     - Detailed export process steps, including how data is gathered, validated, and formatted.
     - Any limitations, such as:
       - The current export does not support selective data filtering; it exports all user settings, life areas, and history.
       - Compression is not applied unless the dataset exceeds a certain size.
       - Future changes in data structure must update both the schema and the export logic to maintain compatibility.

## Questions and Clarifications

- Should additional fields beyond user settings, life areas, and history be included in the export?
- How should the versioning mechanism be designed for future compatibility?
- Is automatic compression required for all exports or only for very large datasets?

## Rollout Plan

- Prototype the export functionality with core data and metadata inclusion.
- Extend the prototype with robust error handling and optional compression.
- Finalize testing and update documentation accordingly.
