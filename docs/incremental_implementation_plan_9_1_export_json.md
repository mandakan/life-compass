# Incremental Implementation Plan for Export Data as JSON (User Story 9.1)

## Overview
This plan outlines the incremental steps to implement the export functionality that allows users to export their Life Compass data as a human-readable JSON file. The implementation covers data gathering, JSON schema definition, metadata inclusion, error handling, and performance considerations.

## Incremental Steps
1. Define JSON Schema
   - Identify required fields such as user settings, life areas, and history.
   - Include metadata fields like export timestamp and version information.
   - Ensure that the schema supports future import functionality.

2. Implement Core Export Functionality
   - Add an export button in the user interface that triggers the JSON export process.
   - Gather data from Local Storage (or the internal state) and serialize it to a JSON string.
   - Validate the JSON output against the predetermined schema.

3. Metadata Inclusion and Error Handling
   - Automatically append metadata (export timestamp, version) to the exported JSON.
   - Implement error handling for scenarios like failure to read data or JSON serialization errors.
   - Display user-friendly error messages when issues occur.

4. Optional Compression for Large Data Sets
   - Evaluate dataset size and determine if compression (e.g., creating a .zip file) is necessary.
   - Implement compression only if performance or file size becomes a concern.

5. Testing and Documentation
   - Create unit tests to validate the JSON export process and metadata correctness.
   - Develop integration tests to simulate end-to-end export scenarios.
   - Update documentation to include the JSON schema, export process details, and any limitations.

## Questions and Clarifications
- Should additional fields beyond user settings, life areas, and history be included in the export?
- How should the versioning mechanism be designed for future compatibility?
- Is automatic compression required for all exports or only for very large datasets?

## Rollout Plan
- Prototype the export functionality with core data and metadata inclusion.
- Extend the prototype with robust error handling and optional compression.
- Finalize testing and update documentation accordingly.
