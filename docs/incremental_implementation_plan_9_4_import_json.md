# Incremental Implementation Plan for Import Data from JSON (User Story 9.4)

## Overview

This plan details the incremental steps to implement the JSON import functionality that allows users to restore their Life Compass data from a previously exported JSON file. The implementation includes file selection, JSON parsing, schema validation, user feedback, backup creation, and data merge versus replace options.

## Incremental Steps

1. File Selection and UI Integration

   - Implement a file selection dialog to allow users to choose a JSON file.
   - Validate the selected fileâ€™s type before processing.

2. JSON Parsing and Schema Validation

   - Parse the JSON file and validate its structure against the defined schema.
   - Handle parsing errors and display appropriate error messages for invalid or corrupted files.

3. User Feedback and Data Preview

   - Provide a summary preview of the JSON data to be imported.
   - Allow users to confirm the import after reviewing the preview.

4. Merge vs. Replace Functionality

   - Offer the option to merge the imported data with existing data or to replace it entirely.
   - Implement conflict handling to manage duplicate or unexpected fields.
   - Display clear warnings about any discrepancies or ignored fields.

5. Backup and Version Handling

   - Automatically create a backup of the current data before proceeding with the import.
   - Implement version mismatch handling by warning the user and offering a best-effort import if versions differ.

6. Testing and Documentation
   - Develop unit tests and integration tests for import scenarios including invalid file formats and version mismatches.
   - Update documentation to include import instructions, schema expectations, and troubleshooting guidelines.

## Questions and Clarifications

- How should version mismatches between the current application schema and the imported JSON be managed? (Initial approach: show a warning and perform a best-effort import upon user confirmation.)
- Should the preview functionality display detailed data or just a summary?
- What specific warnings need to be provided for incomplete or unexpected fields during the import?
- What minimal security checks and validations are required for processing the imported JSON file?

## Rollout Plan

- Develop and test the file selection, JSON parsing, and schema validation features.
- Integrate merge/replace options along with automatic backup mechanisms.
- Perform comprehensive testing with various JSON files and update documentation based on user feedback.
